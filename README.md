Java Beginner Lesson 5

Question 1- We have learned do-while loops and how to implement them. This program gets the number of operands and multiply them by using for loops. At the end, program writes the result.

Question 2- The password generator.  The program takes the number of employees to create them a password by getting their name surname and their special number.  Program gets the letters from the name and surname by using it's length / 2 formula. And using getNumericValue method to convert the char inserted special number to integer. After that program decides the security level of the password with comparing passwords length. If and else commands create a conditional stream. At the end, it gives the number of passwords which is weak, medium or strong, and the weakest and strongest password.
